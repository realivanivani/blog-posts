    " ## Become a Data Scientist in 2024: A Coding Roadmap\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science is generally considered to be a cool profession that offers a variety of exciting career opportunities, but nowadays everyone can become a Data Scientist. Or can they? If you're interested in becoming a data scientist, this blog post is for you. In this post, we'll outline a roadmap that you can follow to learn the skills and knowledge you need to succeed in this field.\n",
    "\n",
    "The roadmap includes the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Coding:** The first step is to get comfortable with coding, especially Python. Python is a versatile programming language that is widely used in data science. There are many great resources available for learning Python, including the Python tutorial by Mosh [1]. This tutorial covers the fundamentals of Python and includes three projects that will help you get hands-on experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Math:** Data science involves some math, but most of the complex math is handled by libraries. However, it is helpful to have a solid understanding of certain mathematical concepts, such as probability, statistics, and calculus. The Khan Academy course on probability and statistics is a great resource for brushing up on your math skills [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Analysis & SQL:** Data analysis is a core skill for data scientists. You'll need to be able to collect, clean, and analyze data from a variety of sources. In this blog post, we'll discuss some of the most popular data analysis tools, including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib [3]. Additionally, SQL is essential for communicating with databases. The udacity course SQL for Data Analysis is a great way to learn SQL [4].\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Machine Learning:** Once you have a foundation in coding, math, and data analysis, you can start learning about machine learning. Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. The Machine Learning Specialization by Deeplearning.AI is a great resource for learning about machine learning [5]. This specialization covers classical machine learning models and includes projects that you can add to your resume.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Deep Learning:** Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks. Deep learning has been successful in a wide range of applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. The Deep Learning Specialization by Deeplearning.AI is a great resource for learning about deep learning [6]. This specialization covers convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for computer vision and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers for natural language processing (NLP).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Work on Projects:** The best way to learn data science is to do it. In addition to completing course projects, you should also try to work on your own projects. This will help you apply your skills and knowledge to real-world problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this roadmap, you can develop the skills and knowledge you need to become a data scientist.\n",
