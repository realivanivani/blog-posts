    "### `manufacturing` Python  package- Ways to analyze manufacturing data \n",
    "\n",
    "TEver heard of Six Sigma? It's a methodology for achieving near-perfect quality in manufacturing. But what if you could leverage Six Sigma tools right from your Python environment? That's where the manufacturing package comes in!\n",
    "\n",
    "he modern factory floor generates a deluge of data, from sensor readings to production logs.  Python offers a robust ecosystem of libraries to harness this data for improved efficiency and quality control. Analyzing process data allows for the identification of trends, anomalies, and potential quality issues, enabling proactive quality control measures.  Furthermore, production data analysis reveals bottlenecks, allowing for optimized scheduling and maximized efficiency. These libraries, akin to specialized software modules, empower sophisticated data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Core libraries like Pandas excel at wrangling tabular data, the lifeblood of manufacturing records.  Pandas allows for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis, forming the bedrock of most data workflows.  NumPy, the workhorse for numerical computations, underpins many libraries and provides efficient data structures for large datasets.  SciPy, building on NumPy's foundation, offers a broader suite of scientific and engineering functions frequently employed in manufacturing analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "By mastering these tools, manufacturers can transform raw data into actionable insights, driving data-driven decision making and achieving operational excellence.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, before going into ways how to process manufacturing data one should first understanding its' core concepts like CpK and Six Sigma Standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is CpK?\n",
    "\n",
    "CpK, or the Process Capability Index, is a statistical measure that shows how well a process is performing relative to its specification limits, or how well a process meets customer specifications. Developed in the 1980s, it considers both the spread of a process's outputs and how centered it is within the acceptable range. A higher Cpk indicates a more capable process with fewer defects. Values below 1 suggest frequent production of out-of-specification items, while those above 1.33 signal a highly capable process. Learn more about Cpk at [Six Sigma Study Guide](sixsigmastudyguide.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cp** measures the process potential by comparing the spread of the process to the specification limits.\n",
    "- **Cpk** measures the process performance by considering both the process spread and its centering relative to the specification limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formula for CpK\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for CpK is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Cpk = \\min \\left( \\frac{3\\sigma \\text{USL} - \\mu}{3\\sigma}, \\frac{3\\sigma \\mu - \\text{LSL}}{3\\sigma} \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\text{USL}$ is the upper specification limit.\n",
    "- $\\text{LSL}$ is the lower specification limit.\n",
    "- $\\mu$ is the process mean.\n",
    "- $\\sigma$ is the process standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A higher CpK value indicates a more capable process. **Values below 1 suggest frequent production of out-of-specification items, while those above 1.33 signal a highly capable process.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Six Sigma?\n",
    "\n",
    "Six Sigma is a data-driven quality improvement methodology that strives for near perfection. Developed by Motorola in the 1980s, it focuses on minimizing defects and variation in any process. It uses a set of statistical tools like Cpk to identify and eliminate the root causes of errors. **A Six Sigma process aims for only 3.4 defects per million opportunities (DPMO), signifying exceptional quality.** Six Sigma certifications demonstrate expertise in this methodology. You can find more details on Six Sigma principles at [Six Sigma.us](sixsigma.us). \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Six Sigma Standard**: Refers to a process that produces output within Â±6 standard deviations (sigma) from the mean, resulting in a very low defect rate.\n",
    "- **Defects Per Million Opportunities (DPMO)**: At Six Sigma level, the process produces only 3.4 defects per million opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sigma Level:** Indicates how many standard deviations a process falls within its specification limits.\n",
    "* **5 Sigma:** Exceptionally high quality with around 233 DPMO (0.023% defect rate).\n",
    "* **4 Sigma:** Very good quality with roughly 6,210 DPMO (0.02% defect rate).\n",
    "* **3 Sigma:** Considered an industry standard with approximately 66,807 DPMO (0.7% defect rate).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, while a 4 sigma process has a defect rate roughly 27 times higher than a 5 sigma process, they both represent a significant reduction in defects compared to a 3 sigma process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of Six Sigma\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improved Quality**: Reduces defects and improves product quality.\n",
    "- **Cost Savings**: Minimizes waste and reduces costs associated with defects.\n",
    "- **Customer Satisfaction**: Enhances customer satisfaction by consistently meeting or exceeding expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features of the `manufacturing` Package\n",
    "\n",
    "This nifty package brings the power of Six Sigma to your fingertips.  Need to calculate a key metric like Cpk? The manufacturing package has you covered. Cpk helps you assess how well your process meets customer specifications, ensuring you're producing high-quality goods.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the manufacturing package isn't a one-trick pony. It also offers tools for calculating other Six Sigma metrics, making it a valuable asset for any data-driven manufacturer. Whether you're a seasoned Six Sigma expert or just starting your quality control journey, this package can streamline your workflow and empower you to make data-driven decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Control Charts**: These are used to monitor the stability of manufacturing processes over time. The package supports various types of control charts, including:\n",
    "   - **X-bar and R charts**: For monitoring the mean and range of a process.\n",
    "   - **P charts**: For monitoring the proportion of defective items in a process.\n",
    "   - **C charts**: For monitoring the count of defects per unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Process Capability Indices**: These indices measure how well a process can produce output within specified limits. The package includes functions to calculate:\n",
    "   - **Cp and Cpk**: Indices that measure a process's capability and its centering within specification limits.\n",
    "   - **Pp and Ppk**: Similar to Cp and Cpk but used for overall process performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Analysis Tools**: The package provides tools for:\n",
    "   - **Descriptive statistics**: To summarize data.\n",
    "   - **Histograms**: To visualize data distribution.\n",
    "   - **Box plots**: To identify outliers and data spread.\n"
